# fucktheac

Fucktheac is a tiny itty bitty little program I wrote while mildly intoxicated,
because Daniel commented that we should write a program to turn the chromecast
volume up and down 2 notches as the air conditioner turned on and off.

Of course, it isn't useful to you unless you have a WeMo, a ChromeCast, and an
odd fascination with automation.

## Usage

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Edit `config.toml` to your liking and run the sucker:

```
$ python -m fucktheac
```
